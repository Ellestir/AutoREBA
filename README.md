# AutoREBA

## Project Description:

AutoREBA (Automatic Rapid Entire Body Assessment Score) is a significant project in the field of human-computer interaction. The aim of this project is to address a research question related to posture ergonomics in Mixed Reality. The overarching theme of the project is "Multimodal Biofeedback for Enhancing Posture Ergonomics in Mixed Reality."

The project involves approximately 13 students working collaboratively to answer the research question. The team comprises four groups, each consisting of three members and a project manager. The groups are divided as follows:
- [Computation and Visualization](Documentation/Computation&Visualization.md)
- [Multi Device Communication](Documentation/Multi_Device_Communication.md)
- [Multimodal Feedback](Documentation/Multimodal_Feedback.md)
- [Ground Truth](Documentation/Ground_Truth.md)

## Requirements:

To execute the project, the following components are required:
- Unity (Version 2021.3.26f1)
- Additional dependencies are specified in the respective directory of the component.

## Installation and Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local computer: `git clone https://github.com/"DeinBenutzername"/AutoREBA`
2. Open the Unity project and navigate to the relevant scene. Start the scene, adjust the limb positions, and observe how the score changes in the output.

## Project Conclusion:

Wrapping up our journey with the REBA-Score and the Optitrack system, it's clear that this project was both a challenge and a fantastic learning experience. With 13 of us, divided into four focused groups, the organisation was a tremendous task.
We each had our own set of hurdles to overcome. Whether it was setting up Optitrack with the VR environment or fixing the code until the REBA-Score feedback was spot on, there were moments that truly tested our mettle.

But here's the thing: amidst these challenges, we learned a ton about teamwork and organization. The diverse skills in our team not only made problem-solving more dynamic but also made the process genuinely enjoyable. We shared knowledge, supported each other, and celebrated our small successes along the way.

We're genuinely excited about the potential of our work. Implementing posture feedback in virtual and mixed reality could be a game-changer for many. We're hopeful that our efforts will pave the way for real-world applications that can make a positive impact on people's lives.

In retrospect, while we faced our fair share of challenges. We've grown as a team, enjoyed the process, and are proud of our collective output. Here's to our work serving as a foundation for future innovations and truly making a difference!
