# AutoREBA - Ground Truth

## Overview:
In order to assess the individual body parts and their respective scores we used the official ErgoPlus’ website and PDF document “A Step-by-Step Guide to the REBA Assessment Tool” 
This included explanations, pictures and the tables used to determine the scores that make up the final REBA score.

As the website outlines, we took multiple pictures and videos to assess the posture accurately. 
Firstly we took videos from two different angles from which we took screenshots and noted down their timestamps within the video. 
Additionally we used Motive, a motion capture program with which we could track the target's movement precisely and from multiple angles at once. To achieve this the person to be measured needed to wear a full body suit with reflective knobs that the setup cameras around the room could recognise. The accurate position of the knobs on the person was of great importance due to the program needing this precision to better follow the person's movement.

### Good Posture:

This posture we ended up giving a perfect score of 1. We evaluated the neck as having a subscore of 1 as it is barely bent forward if it all, it is not twisted or bent. Whether it is bent may be controversial but as the official page does not mention any angles we decided here that this is not bent enough to add +1.

Similarly, the trunk is straight, not twisted or bent. Leading to a score of +1. 

The legs are straight and he is standing on both legs equally, leading to a score of +1.

Force load is 0 due to the box he is holding being below 11 lbs. 

The upper arm is at a slight angle but not more than 20 degrees, so it is +1. The shoulders are not raised, the arm is not abducted and he is not leaning. 

The lower arm is at an angle of ~90 degrees leading to a score of +1. 

Wrists look to be straight and not bend or twisted, so +1. 

Coupling looks to be a little awkward, as no handles are present, but we deemed it possible so +2. 

Activity score wise the movement was picking up a light box once. So neither the repeated actions nor the held body parts for longer than a minute apply. 
Picking up a box also does not cause a rapid large range change in posture and the base was stable. Thus +0 for the activity score. 

Inputting the subscores into the given tables and adding the coupling score and force load gives a Score A of 1 and a Score B of 1. Inputting these into Table C gives a Score of 1, adding onto the +0 of the activity score leaves it at a 1, giving an end score of 1.
