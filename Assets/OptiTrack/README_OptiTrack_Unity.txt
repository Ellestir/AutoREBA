Version History / Changelog
---------------------------

1.4.0 (2021-08-09)
-----
- Added the ability to visualize camera positions.
- Added the ability to visualize force plate positions 
- Cleaned up unused fixes. 
- Updated the NatNet libraries to use NatNet 4.0. 


1.3.1 (2021-04-22)
-----
- Congested Network Improvements - Changes added to improve performance for
  high asset counts or congested networks. 
-- Increased the wait time and number of attempts when subscribing to assets.
-- Added an option to skip getting the data descriptions from Motive. 
   This will reduce network traffic on startup, but skeleton streaming will 
   not work when this option is enabled. 
-- Reduced the frequency of the Unicast keep alive messages from every 250 ms
   to every 1000 ms. This should yield 1/4 of the network traffic generated by
   those messages.
- Finger Tracking - Motive finger data may now be streamed into Unity.
- Marker Names - Markers now identify as Active, Passive (unlabeled), 
  or Labeled (with the associated asset and memberID).
- Active markers now appear as cyan spheres in Unity to visually distinguish
  them from other markers.
- The "Bone Naming Convention" and "Skeleton Coordinates" properties remotely
  change in Motive to match Unity's streaming settings. 
- Updated the plugin's property visuals to have section headers and tool tips. 
- Added the ability to stream skeletons as either Local or Global Skeleton
  Coordinates.
- Possibly fixed a gimbal lock issue when using global skeleton coordinates. 
- Fixed a bug where skeletons would not stream when using Unicast due to a
  skeleton subscription bug in Motive 2.2.0. 
- Fixed a bug where markers would not stream when using Unicast. 
- Fixed a bug where the remote property setting wasn't working consistently. 


1.3.0 (2021-02-10)
-----
- Unicast Subscription - Added the ability to subscribe to data with Unicast 
  connection to Motive. This ensures that only necessary information is streamed
  to the client minimizing wireless traffic. (Compatible with Motive 2.2+)
- HMDs use XR Plugins - Unity updated their HMD workflow. To use OpenVR with
  Unity you will need the OpenVR XR Plugin from Valve. We have removed the 
  depricated HMD scripts from the plugin. 
- Global Skeleton Coordinates - The plugin now uses global skeleton coordinates
  to standardize between our other plugins. This setting is now automatically 
  changes when you start streaming. 
- Added the ability to start/stop recording in Motive when playing in Unity.
- Added some example code for accessing timecode information when available. 
- Removed depricated query for rigid body marker data.
- Fixed issues with the plugin caused by engine updates. 


1.2.0 (2018-09-19)
-----
- Updated the NatNet DLL which now allows users to stream over 100 rigid bodies. 
- Added Draw Markers option to the OptiTrack Streaming Client object for 
  displaying streamed marker data as sphere objects in the scene.
- Added a rigid body prefab for first-time users.
- Compatibility updates for Unity 2018.2


1.1.0 (2017-12-05)
-----
- Implemented late update functionality when using Unity 2017.1+, which
