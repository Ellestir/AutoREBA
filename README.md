The project involves approximately 13 students working collaboratively to answer the research question. The team comprises four groups, each consisting of three members and a project manager. The groups are divided as follows:
- [Computation and Visualization](Documentation/Computation&Visualization.md)
- [Multi Device Communication](Documentation/Multi_Device_Communication.md)
- [Multimodal Feedback](Documentation/Multimodal_Feedback.md)
- [Ground Truth](Documentation/Ground_Truth.md)

## Requirements:

To execute the project, the following components are required:
- Unity (Version 2021.3.26f1)
